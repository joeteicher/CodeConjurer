**Component Plan for LLM API Interface**

**Purpose:**
The LLM API Interface component serves as the bridge between the CodeSorcerer system and a Large Language Model (LLM) API. Its primary function is to facilitate communication, sending requests to and receiving responses from the LLM, and handling related data processing.

**Description:**
This component will manage the API calls to a specific LLM (such as OpenAI's GPT model) for various purposes, including generating code, summaries, and processing natural language queries. It will handle tasks like constructing requests, parsing responses, error handling, and rate limiting. The component ensures efficient and effective use of the LLM by optimizing requests and caching responses where appropriate.

**List of Functions:**
1. `send_request`: Sends a request to the LLM API with specified parameters.
2. `parse_response`: Parses the response received from the LLM API.
3. `handle_api_error`: Manages errors encountered during API interaction.
4. `cache_response`: Optionally caches responses for frequent requests to reduce API calls.
5. `format_query`: Prepares and formats queries for sending to the LLM API.
6. `retrieve_cached_response`: Retrieves responses from the cache, if available.
7. `rate_limit_handling`: Manages rate limits imposed by the LLM API.

**Files to be Created:**
1. **llm_api.py**
   - Contains core functionalities like `send_request`, `parse_response`, `handle_api_error`.
2. **query_formatter.py**
   - Dedicated to formatting queries with `format_query`.
3. **cache_manager.py**
   - Manages caching of responses with `cache_response` and `retrieve_cached_response`.
4. **rate_limit.py**
   - Handles API rate limiting through `rate_limit_handling`.
